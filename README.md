## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React Native** with Expo
- **React Navigation** for navigation
- **expo-web-browser** for PDF viewing (Expo Go compatible)
- **AsyncStorage** for data persistence
- **expo-av** for future audio features

## 📋 Installation & Setup

1. **Navigate to project:**
   ```bash
   cd MobileReadingApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

4. **Run on device:**
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app (iOS/Android)
   - Or press 'a' for Android emulator
   - Or press 'i' for iOS simulator

## 🎯 Design Principles Applied

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Components can be extended without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Components are interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depends on abstractions, not concretions

### Other Principles
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Simple, clear implementations
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reusable functions and components
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Only implement what's needed

## 📊 Data Structure

Books are organized by grade level with the following structure:
```javascript
{
  grade: {
    intensive: [
      {
        id: 'unique_id',
        title: 'Book Title',
        grade: 1,
        type: 'intensive',
        pdfUrl: 'https://example.com/book.pdf',
        totalPages: 10,
        completed: false
      }
    ],
    extensive: [
      // Similar structure with quizQuestions array
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Progress Tracking

Progress is stored in AsyncStorage with the key pattern:
```
progress_grade_${grade}
```

Each book's progress includes:
- Current page
- Total pages
- Completion status
- Last read timestamp
- Book title and type

## 📖 PDF Reading Experience

The app uses **expo-web-browser** to provide a native PDF reading experience:

1. **📄 Open PDF**: Tap button to open PDF in device's default PDF viewer
2. **📊 Manual Progress**: Return to app and update your reading progress
3. **⚡ Quick Jump**: Jump to specific pages (start, 25%, 50%, 75%, end)
4. **📈 Auto-Save**: Progress is automatically saved as you update it

This approach ensures **Expo Go compatibility** while providing a smooth reading experience.

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Modern Design**: Clean, professional interface
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on various screen sizes
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bars and percentages
- **Achievement System**: Unlockable badges and milestones
- **Smooth Navigation**: Intuitive navigation flow
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **External PDF Viewer**: Native PDF reading experience

## 🚧 Next Steps (Phase 2 & 3)

### Phase 2: Extensive Learning Features
- [ ] Extensive books listing
- [ ] 30-second timer per page
- [ ] Audio recording functionality
- [ ] Automatic page turning
- [ ] Failure tracking and reset logic

### Phase 3: Quizzes and Enhanced Profile
- [ ] Post-reading quizzes
- [ ] Score calculation and stickers
- [ ] Audio playback in profile
- [ ] Enhanced progress analytics

## ✅ Expo Go Compatibility

This app is fully compatible with **Expo Go** and doesn't require:
- ❌ Ejecting to bare React Native
- ❌ Custom development builds
- ❌ Native module compilation

Simply scan the QR code and start using the app immediately!

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

- ✅ **Native Module Errors**: Fixed by using expo-web-browser instead of react-native-pdf
- ✅ **Expo Go Compatibility**: App works seamlessly in Expo Go
- ⚠️ **PDF Reading**: Requires device's PDF viewer app (most devices have one built-in)

## 📝 Notes

This is Phase 1 of the MVP. The application provides a solid foundation for reading education with proper progress tracking and a beautiful user interface. All code follows best practices and is ready for Phase 2 implementation.

The switch to **expo-web-browser** ensures maximum compatibility while maintaining a great user experience.
